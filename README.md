# Prices_Formulas_View

The project is to design and implement a responsive page that allows users to apply a mathematical formula to a list of products.
Some of the requirements were:

- The component should have an "edit" mode
- The component should have a "display" mode
- The user should be able to cancel the changes being made to a formula
- The component should handle the validation of the mathematical formula
- Some products should already have a formula applied
- Use semantic HTML
- Make it responsive

This has been the result of my project.

Of the 3 products I currently have, the first is manually entered into the li and the other two are imported from a json file.

The operation of the operations works correctly in the first product, the other two I have been working on but I have not been able to make them work.
